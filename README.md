# Contentful and Sveltekit starter

Everything you need to build a [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) project with Contentful. This starter shows you how to:

- Fetch data from the Contentful GraphQL API
- Create dynamic routes
- Use the Svelte component Lifecycle
- Display a map using [Maplibre](https://maplibre.org/)

## Developing

Once you've installed the dependencies with `npm install`, run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server and open the app in a new browser tab.

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
